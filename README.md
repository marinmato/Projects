Contains HeelRide as outlined on my resume. The app is under development. Below, you can read more on how I came across this idea and more. 


> It all started one Friday afternoon, a few hours after I missed my train – the only way for me to get home that day. I had to wait until Saturday morning now. On the way back to my dorm, I was thinking to myself 

“There has to be an easier way to get home that doesn’t directly involve me driving”.

> I had just crashed my car a couple months before, hitting a tree and totaling the vehicle. I made it without any injuries, but driving was clearly not the most enjoyable activity for me at the time, not for another few more months at least. As an out-of-state student, getting home has always been quite the journey for me. The distance from Chapel Hill to Northern Virginia is too short for a flight, but long enough for me to contemplate between taking the train or the bus every single time. 
	
 “What if there’s a ride-sharing app for long distances?”

> Finding a ride is not a problem nowadays with Uber and Lyft dominating the industry, but how do I make long-distance rides affordable to students? Simple (well not-so simple). Get other students to do it. If I’m a student who’s driving to Charlotte, I wouldn’t want more than $30 just to drive another student to the same destination. And that’s how I first thought of building HeelRide. By students for students. Affordable. Reliable (hopefully). I spent the next two weeks only thinking about why this project wouldn’t work. After much considerations and discussions with friends, I figured that it was a great idea. Now, it all depended on me, a statistics and math major, figuring out how to develop a flawless mobile app, that hundreds of people might depend on to go home one day.
